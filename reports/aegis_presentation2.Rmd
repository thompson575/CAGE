## Extraction and Selection

* **Feature Extraction** derives transformed values (features) that capture the majority of the information in a dataset. 

<br>

* Feature extraction is sometimes called **dimensionality reduction**.  

<br>

* **Feature Selection** identifies a subset of the features important for a particular task.

## Extraction and Selection

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph dot {


graph [layout = dot,
       rankdir = LR,
       ranksep = 2]

node [shape = circle,
      style = filled,
      width = 1,
      label = ' ']
 
edge [color = black]

     
subgraph cluster_data {
    label = 'Raw Data';
    x1 [color = green] x2 [color = green] x3 [color = green] 
    x4 [color = green]  x5 [color = green] x6 [color = green];
  }      


subgraph cluster_features {
    label = 'Features';
    z1 [color = cyan ] z2 [color = cyan ] 
    z3 [color = cyan ] z4 [color = cyan ];
  }      

subgraph cluster_selection {
    label = 'Selection';
    w2 [color = red];
    w4 [color = red];

  }      

x1 -> {z1 z2 z3} 
x2 -> {z1 z3 z4} 
x3 -> {z1 z3 z4} 
x4 -> {z2 z3 z4} 
x5 -> {z1 z3 z4} 
x5 -> {z2 z3 z4}
x6 -> {z1 z2 z4}
    z2 -> w2 
    z4 -> w4;

}")
```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* Method for dimensionality reduction (feature extraction)

* uncorrelated linear combinations of the raw data  

* successively orientated in the direction of maximum variance

## AEGIS Trials I and II

Airway Epithelium Gene Expression in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
patientDF %>%
  ggplot( aes( x= study, fill = diagnosis)) +
  geom_bar( position = "dodge") +
  labs( title = "Numbers of cancer and benign cases in each study")
```

## The Investigation

- Develop a model to classify cancer/benign

- Use AEGIS-1 to train the model and AEGIS-2 to validate  

- Methods Investigated

  - No Feature Extraction .. Select the M probes that best classify  
  - Use PCA for feature extraction .. Use the first M PCs
  - PCA for feature extraction .. Select the M PCs that best classify  
  
- PCA applied to the raw data and to the scaled raw data  

## Loss Function

Logistic regression models are to predict the cancer cases

Model performance is assessed using the cross-entropy loss
\[
- \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N y_i log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i) log(1-\hat{y}_i)
\]

This is equivalent to the log-likelihood for a logistic regression

## Results: In-sample 1-50 Features

```{r}
list( probe  = r$probeSelectedDF,
      vPCsel = r$vpcaSelectedDF,
      vPCord = r$vpcaOrderedDF,
      cPCsel = r$cpcaSelectedDF,
      cPCord = r$cpcaOrderedDF)  %>%
  plot_method_comparison(inloss) +
  ggtitle("In-sample loss for the 5 feature selection methods")
```

## Results: In-sample 1-8 Features

```{r}
list( probe  = r$probeSelectedDF %>% slice(1:8),
      vPCsel = r$vpcaSelectedDF  %>% slice(1:8),
      vPCord = r$vpcaOrderedDF   %>% slice(1:8),
      cPCsel = r$cpcaSelectedDF  %>% slice(1:8),
      cPCord = r$cpcaOrderedDF   %>% slice(1:8))  %>%
  plot_method_comparison(inloss) +
  ggtitle("In-sample loss for the 5 feature selection methods")

```

## Results: Out-of-sample 1-50 Features

```{r}
list( probe  = r$probeSelectedDF,
      vPCsel = r$vpcaSelectedDF,
      vPCord = r$vpcaOrderedDF,
      cPCsel = r$cpcaSelectedDF,
      cPCord = r$cpcaOrderedDF)  %>%
  plot_method_comparison(outloss) +
  ggtitle("Out-of-sample loss for the 5 feature selection methods")
```


## Results: Out-of-sample 1-8 Features

```{r}
list( probe  = r$probeSelectedDF %>% slice(1:8),
      vPCsel = r$vpcaSelectedDF  %>% slice(1:8),
      vPCord = r$vpcaOrderedDF   %>% slice(1:8),
      cPCsel = r$cpcaSelectedDF  %>% slice(1:8),
      cPCord = r$cpcaOrderedDF   %>% slice(1:8))  %>%
  plot_method_comparison(outloss) +
  ggtitle("Out-of-sample loss for the 5 feature selection methods")
```

## Conclusions

* Features selected in AEGIS-1 perform poorly in AEGIS-2  
* Scaled and unscaled PCA performs equally well  
* In-sample performance suggests that 
  - selected PCs out perform selected probes  
  - the first PCs predict particularly poorly  
* Out-of-sample results do not support the use of selected PCs  
  - suggesting that small PCs over-fit the training data
